# CitationPerformance
A new method to rank researchers fairly by citation performance

Requires R code 'new citation index Github.R' and the sample data file 'newcitationindexsample.csv'

Of course, I encourage you to make your own samples following the format in the .csv file. It's probably best to consider at least 15-20 researchers in each sample.
